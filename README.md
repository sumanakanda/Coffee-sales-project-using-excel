# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an Excel-based Coffee Sales Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize coffee sales data effectively. The data was sourced from a YouTube video by Mo Chan, and I processed it to meet the project's requirements. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, product performance, and other key metrics to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs for better data understanding.
- **Key Metrics**: Summarized KPIs, including total sales, top-performing products, and sales trends over time.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data to enhance usability and accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Design**: A well-organized and visually appealing layout for ease of navigation.

## How It Works
1. **Data Source**: The dataset contains information on coffee orders, including dates, product types, quantities, and sales amounts.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processed the raw data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Leveraged Excelâ€™s capabilities (e.g., pivot tables, slicers, and charts) to build the dashboard.

## Files in the Repository
- `coffeeOrdersData.xlsx`: The raw dataset containing coffee sales information.
- `coffeeOrdersProject using excel.xlsx`: The Excel file with the processed data and completed dashboard.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, processing, and dashboard creation.

## How to Use
1. Download the `coffeeOrdersProject using excel.xlsx` file.
2. Open it in Microsoft Excel.
3. Explore the dashboard to analyze sales data using the provided filters and visualizations.

## Potential Improvements
- Automate data updates using Power Query.
- Expand visualizations with advanced Excel tools like Power Pivot.
- Integrate with other tools like Power BI for more interactivity.
